# LookToFocus: Image Focus via Eye Tracking
This repository is for the data browser and our experiment platform.

## Dataset
Data files can be downloaded from the project page. These files allow the python simulation to be realistic as Python doesn't support fast enough computation of filter information.

## Code
### Prerequisites
Requirements are in the requirements.txt file.

## Run
Just run the browser by hooking up the GazePoint Eyetracker and running experiment_browser.py.
