# LookToFocus: Image Focus via Eye Tracking
This repository is for the data browser and our experiment platform.

https://sites.google.com/view/tedlasai/home/looktofocus-image-focus-via-image-eyetracking

## Dataset
Data files can be downloaded from the project page. These files allow the python simulation to be realistic as Python doesn't support fast enough computation of filter information.
Place the files in a folder "data" at the same level as the python files.

## Code
### Prerequisites
Python 3.9
Requirements are in the requirements.txt file.

## Run
Just run the browser by hooking up the GazePoint Eyetracker and running experiment_browser.py.
